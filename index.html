      <p>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
        in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.</p>

      <p>‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a
        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
        for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
        The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
        the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</p>

          <p>Jonathan Walters</p>
          <p>Verified Graduate</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>The team was very supportive and kept me motivated</p>

      <p>‚Äú I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer
        for a big company. This was one of the best investments I‚Äôve made in myself. ‚Äù</p>
    </div>

    <div class="jeanette">
      <div>
        <img src="./images/image-jeanette.jpg" alt="jeanette">
        <div>
          <p>Jeanette Harmon</p>
          <p>Verified Graduate</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>An overall wonderful and rewarding experience</p>

      <p>‚Äú Thank you for the wonderful experience! I now have a job I really enjoy, and make a good living
        while doing something I love. ‚Äù</p>
    </div>

    <div class="patrick">
      <div>
        <img src="./images/image-patrick.jpg" alt="patrick">
        <div>
          <p>Patrick Abrams</p>
          <p>Verified Graduate</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and
        learning from their experiences was easy.</p>

      <p>‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program
        gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
        junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
        an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù</p>
    </div>

    <div class="kira">
      <div>
        <img src="./images/image-kira.jpg" alt="kira">
        <div>
          <p>Kira Whittle</p>
          <p>Verified Graduate</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>

      <p>‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
        did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
        project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
        could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
        experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
        100% recommend! ‚Äù</p>
